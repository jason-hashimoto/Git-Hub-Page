## Relationship between Bat Speed and Point of Interest (POI) metrics

Bat Speed Data Analysis on Driveline's Open Biomechanics Project.

https://www.openbiomechanics.org/

By: Wasserberger KW, Brady AC, Besky DM, Jones BR, Boddy KJ. The OpenBiomechanics Project: The open source initiative for anonymized, elite-level athletic motion capture data. (2022).

This was completely inspired by Steve Schuster, Author of Growcasting. His twitter handle is @growcasting, and his twitter thread focused on using the POI metrics from Driveline Baseball on pitching and attempting to predict pitch velocity. Similarily, this analysis looked at POI metrics on hitting and attempted to predict bat speed.

The sample was mostly college guys, distribution of the sample and relevant information (POI Metrics) on the variables tested can be found here: https://github.com/drivelineresearch/openbiomechanics/tree/main/baseball_hitting

```{r library, include=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("dplyr")
library("vip")
library("xgboost")
library("caret")
library("knitr")
library("reshape2")
library("ggplot2")
library("imputeTS")
library("sjPlot")
library("sjmisc")
library("sjlabelled")
library("ggpmisc")

df <- read_csv("poi_metrics.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

```

## Bat Speed Model

Removed the first 17 columns, which included mostly contact/bat metrics, which would flood the model with relationships already well understood (Ex: Bat Speed and Exit Velocity, Bat Speed and Attack Angle, etc). A simple Linear Regression model was then run with the remaining 110 variables available in the POI metrics dataframe. 677 observations were used in the mode, returning an R-squared of 0.613, which is a moderate correlation.  


```{r Model}
#Bat Speed Model
all_metrics <- df %>% select(-c(1:17)) %>% as.data.frame()
formula <- as.formula(paste("bat_speed_mph_contact_x ~", 
                            paste(setdiff(names(all_metrics), 
                                  c("pelvis_fm_x", "pelvis_fm_y", "pelvis_fm_z", "pelvis_launchpos_x", "pelvis_launchpos_y", "pelvis_launchpos_z", "pelvis_angular_velocity_swing_max_x",
                                    "torso_angular_velocity_swing_max_x","torso_fm_x","torso_fm_y","torso_fm_z", "torso_launchpos_x", "torso_launchpos_y","torso_launchpos_z", 
                                    "torso_pelvis_fm_x","torso_pelvis_launchpos_x","upper_arm_speed_mag_seq_max_x","upper_arm_speed_mag_swing_max_velo_x","bat_max_x","bat_min_x")),
                                  collapse = "+")))
model <- lm(formula, data = df)
tab_model(model, dv.labels = c("Bat Speed (mph)"))
```

## VIP Importance

Using the VIP package, we can see the 10 predictors that had the most importance to the linear model.

```{r VIP, echo=FALSE}
#Top predictors in the model
vip_scores <- vip(model)
print(vip_scores)
```

## XGBoost Models

Using 5 different XGBoost models, returning improved R-squared and RMSE values, as well as MAE and MSE. 

```{r xgboost, echo = T, results = 'hide'}

x <- model.matrix(formula, data = df)
y <- df$bat_speed_mph_contact_x

boost <- xgb.DMatrix(data = x, label = y)
boost_test <- xgb.DMatrix(data = x, label = y)

models <- list()
rmse <- c()
for (i in 1:5) {
  params <- list(eta = 0.1, max_depth = 3, subsample = 0.5, colsample_bytree = 0.5)
  result <- xgb.cv(data = boost, params = params, nrounds = 100, nfold = 5, early_stopping_rounds = 10, maximize = FALSE)
  model <- xgboost(data = boost, params = params, nrounds = 100, early_stopping_rounds = 10)
  models[[i]] <- model
  rmse[[i]] <- result$evaluation_log$train_rmse_mean
}

model_metrics <- data.frame(Model = character(), MSE = numeric(), 
                            MAE = numeric(), RMSE = numeric(), R_square = numeric())
```

```{r xgboost metrics}
for (i in 1:5) {
  pred_y <- predict(models[[i]], boost)
  mse <- mean((y - pred_y)^2)
  mae <- caret::MAE(y, pred_y)
  rmse <- caret::RMSE(y, pred_y)
  
  models_mean <- mean(y)
  residuals <- y - pred_y
  tss <- sum((y - models_mean)^2)
  rss <- sum(residuals^2)
  rsq <- 1 - (rss/tss)
  
  model_metrics <- rbind(model_metrics, data.frame(Model = paste("Model", i), MSE = mse, 
                                                   MAE = mae, RMSE = rmse, R_square = rsq))
}

kable(model_metrics)
```

## Original vs. Predicted Bat Speed
Using this graph, we can see how well the Predicted Bat Speed Model faired against bat speed in the dataframe.

```{r predicted}

#Plot to find out how the original test and predicted bat speed model compared

x = 1:length(y)
plot(x, y, col = "red", type = "l")
lines(x, pred_y, col = "blue", type = "l")
legend(x = 1, y = 38,  legend = c("original test_y", "predicted test_y"), 
       col = c("red", "blue"), box.lty = 1, cex = 0.8, lty = c(1, 1))
```

## XGBoost Models VIP

For each of the 5 XGBoost models, we can use the VIP package to see which variables were the most important to predict bat speed. Most of these will have similar values, however there is a big difference between these predictors and the predictors that were highlighted in the original model. 

```{r xgboost models vip}
#XGBoost Models VIP
vip_scores_list <- list()

for (i in 1:length(models)) {
  vip_scores_list[[i]] <- vip(models[[i]])
  print(vip_scores_list[[i]])
}

```

## Top 10 Variable list

This just calculates the Top 10 Variables list, which takes into account all 5 of the XGBoost models and determines which variables were the most important. 

```{r top10var, echo = T, results = 'hide'}
#Top 10 Variables
vip_scores_list = unlist(vip_scores_list, recursive = FALSE)
vip_scores_list = unlist(vip_scores_list, recursive = FALSE)

Variable1 <- vip_scores_list[[1]]
Variable2 <- vip_scores_list[[13]]
Variable3 <- vip_scores_list[[25]]
Variable4 <- vip_scores_list[[37]]
Variable5 <- vip_scores_list[[49]]

Importance1 <- vip_scores_list[[2]]
Importance2 <- vip_scores_list[[14]]
Importance3 <- vip_scores_list[[26]]
Importance4 <- vip_scores_list[[38]]
Importance5 <- vip_scores_list[[50]]

all_variable <- c(Variable1, Variable2, Variable3, Variable4, Variable5)
all_importance <- c(Importance1, Importance2, Importance3, Importance4, Importance5)

vip_scores_df <- data.frame(Variable = all_variable, Importance = all_importance)
vip_scores_df <- vip_scores_df[order(-vip_scores_df$Importance), ]
unique_vars <- unique(vip_scores_df$Variable)
top_10_vars <- head(unique_vars, 10)
```

## VIP Variable Boost Model

Using the Top 10 Variables described from the xgboost model, I ran those 10 variables into another xgboost model to see how well it would perform and if the importance would change. This model performed fairly poorly in comparison to the previous models, resulting in a R-squared of 0.297 and an RMSE of 4.

```{r vip boost model, echo = T, results = 'hide'}
#VIP Variable Boost model
var_string <- paste(top_10_vars, collapse = " + ")
formula_string <- paste("bat_speed_mph_contact_x ~ ", var_string, sep = "")
formula_vip <- as.formula(formula_string)
model_vip <- lm(formula_vip, data = df)

x_vip <- model.matrix(formula_vip, data = df, data.frame = TRUE)
y_vip <- df$bat_speed_mph_contact_x

boost_vip <- xgb.DMatrix(data = x_vip, label = y_vip)
boost_test_vip <- xgb.DMatrix(data = x_vip, label = y_vip)

models_vip <- list()
rmse_vip <- c()
for (i in 1) {
  params <- list(eta = 0.1, max_depth = 3, subsample = 0.5, colsample_bytree = 0.5)
  result <- xgb.cv(data = boost_vip, params = params, nrounds = 100, nfold = 5, early_stopping_rounds = 10, maximize = FALSE)
  model <- xgboost(data = boost_vip, params = params, nrounds = 100, early_stopping_rounds = 10)
  models_vip[[i]] <- model_vip
  rmse_vip[[i]] <- result$evaluation_log$train_rmse_mean
}
```
```{r vip boost model metrics}
#Models VIP Top 10 variables
top10_model <- models_vip[[1]]
vip_top10_model <- vip(top10_model)
print(vip_top10_model)

top10_model_metrics <- data.frame(Model = character(), MSE = numeric(), 
                            MAE = numeric(), RMSE = numeric(), R_square = numeric())

for (i in 1) {
  x_vip_df <- as.data.frame(x_vip)
  pred_y_vip <- predict(models_vip[[i]], newdata = x_vip_df)
  mse_vip <- mean((y_vip - pred_y_vip)^2)
  mae_vip <- caret::MAE(y_vip, pred_y_vip)
  rmse_vip <- caret::RMSE(y_vip, pred_y_vip)
  
  models_mean_vip <- mean(y_vip)
  residuals_vip <- y_vip - pred_y_vip
  tss_vip <- sum((y_vip - models_mean_vip)^2)
  rss_vip <- sum(residuals_vip^2)
  rsq_vip <- 1 - (rss_vip/tss_vip)
  
  top10_model_metrics <- rbind(top10_model_metrics, data.frame(Model = paste("Model", i), MSE = mse_vip, 
                                                   MAE = mae_vip, RMSE = rmse_vip, R_square = rsq_vip))
}

kable(top10_model_metrics)
```
```{r outliers, include=FALSE}
df2 <- read_csv("poi_metrics.csv")

find_and_replace_outliers <- function(x) {
  stats <- boxplot.stats(x)
  outliers <- c(stats$out)
  mean_val <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  x[x %in% outliers] <- mean_val
  return(x)
}

# Find the numeric columns of the dataframe
numeric_cols <- sapply(df2, is.numeric)

# Apply the function to each numeric column of the dataframe
df2[,numeric_cols] <- lapply(df2[,numeric_cols], find_and_replace_outliers)
```

## Takeaways

There were some interesting takeaways that were found from running the models and presenting their relationships in the scatterplots. Here are some thoughts that I had about the top 10 variables:

* **hand_speed_mag_seq_max_x** and **hand_speed_mag_swing_max_velo_x**: Rather unsurprisingly, two hand speed metrics were the top or near the top for importance in the models, showing that hand speed is important for bat speed (who knew?).
* **torso_angular_velocity_maxhss_x**: Torso angular velocity showing a relationship to bat speed also follows conventional hitting wisdom, and in this case further proves the importance of hip-shoulder separation. Generating as much velocity as possible at HSS allows the individual to propel their torso into rotation and generate faster bat speeds. 
* **rear_shoulder_stride_max_z**: Although this variable showed significant importance in the xgboost models, doing a linear regression showed little to no relationship with bat speed. I would be wary of utilizing this variable. One thought that came to mind with this variable is keeping the bat steady and at a certain angle once the hitter gets into his load and starts to stride towards the pitcher. 
* **torso_angular_velocity_seq_max_x**: Similar to the previous variable, torso angular velocity is also important to generate from first move to contact, allowing the torso to get into a favorable position early. 
* **x_factor_fm_x**: Another chalk variable, x-factor or torso-pelvis angle (x) is important so that the hitter can set themselves in a good position to rotate after first move. To simply generate more bat speed, getting into a slightly more flexed position (0-10 deg) at first move is advantageous. There are exceptions to this statement, but making sure that the hitter is not in extreme extension (-20 or more degrees) is key. 
* **torso_stride_max_z**: This was the only variable in the top 10 that there was an inverse relationship with bat speed. More notably, axial rotation away from the pitcher or towards the catcher showed a relationship with bat speed. This makes sense when combining this variable with torso angular velocity, as having more axial rotation away from the pitcher should allow the hitter to generate more rotation and allow them to swing faster.
* **lead_knee_stride_max_x**: This variable surprised me, and I would not recommend a coach or player to focus too heavily on this metric. Excessive knee flexion in this stride phase can lead to issues outside of simply generating bat speed, although this does make conventional sense.
* **pelvis_angular_velocity_maxhss_x**: Again, this variable builds on the torso angular velocity metrics, and also builds the case for the importance of HSS. Allowing the hitter to propel their pelvis into rotation, and then their torso, followed by arms and hands, aka the kinetic chain, generates more bat speed.
* **rear_shoulder_launchpos_x**: The relationship of the rear shoulder angle and bat speed was also somewhat surprising, considering that it doesn't directly relate to the kinetic chain. Making sure to not drop the shoulder/bat before footplant seems to be even more relevant to being able to swing the bat fast.
